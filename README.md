# Artifact of Second Chance
### JohnEdwa

## Thanks

EvanTich for creating the [excellent example for custom Artifacts](https://github.com/EvanTich/ror2-modding/tree/master/ExampleArtifact) and Jarlyk on the modding discord for helping me with the IL stuff.

## Description

Adds a new Artifact called the Artifact of Second Chance which modifies the spent Dio's Best Friend with a curse that reduces your max HP, Regen and Movement Speed, but also gives you one at the beginning of the game, because an extra life is more reliable than relying only on the One Shot Protection.

The exact effect of each stack of "Dio's Affliction" after resurrection is:

* Increases "Curse" (Shaped Glass, Spinel Tonic) by 15%, which reduces your Max HP and disables One Shot Protection.
* Reduces your Regen and Movement Speed by 15%.

## Configuration

Not implemented yet.

## Known Issues

None so far.

## To-Do

Add config options.
Tune the affliction to balance the Artifact properly.
